# Location-Finder-App
This project can be used as an alternative to google maps.
In this project, I created a map from geopy python library to show the available destinations for the user to go
I have taken a dataset of london city with the availabe pub locations and performed data cleaning,preprocessing in order to get the desired output
And also with the help of streamlit created a software application wherein we can specify our search and can see the same through the map
